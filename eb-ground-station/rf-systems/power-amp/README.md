### Linear power amplifier

Power amplifiers using hybrid power amplifier modules from
Mitsubishi or Hitachi are used to drive the antenna.

Testing data is included in the spreadsheet, including characteristics of the power output monitor voltage.

Additionally, the output of the LimeSDR is a little too low to fully drive the power amplifires, so inline MMIC
amplifiers are placed in between.
