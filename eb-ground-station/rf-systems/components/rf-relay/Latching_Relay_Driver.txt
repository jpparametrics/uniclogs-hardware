Latching Relay Driver Design Notes
G.N. LeBrasseur  15-Sep-2021

The essential concept of the design using a capacitor and a totem pole driver is inspired by Rick Fogle, WA5TNY, Latching Relay Driver Circuit.
 * ARRL UHF/Microwave Projects Manual, Volume 1, pg. 4-6
 * Microwave Update Proceedings 1991

Whereas the circuit described was for only a single coil relay, the addition of the two current routing diodes provides
the needed current paths required to operate a dual coil relay.

The back-EMF supression function provided by the two back-to-back zener diodes is replaced by use of a MOV.

The connector pin order is:
   Input:
      1 - GND
      2 - Totem Pole 12V On/Off signal
   Output:
      3 - Relay coil #1
      4 - Relay common
      5 - Relay coil #2
