To get the thing to work correectly with HAMLIB:
   At line 12229:
      Swap the comment-out part between "+" and "AZ"

   At line 12262:
      Swap the comment-out part between "+" and "EL"

There is a OPTION_HAMLIB_EASYCOM_AZ_EL_COMMAND_HACK compile switch in rotator_features.h however it does not
fix the issue we found with HAMLIB. It's implemented very close to the above fixes but only provides a new combined
AZ / EL query command called "Z". Totally unrelated.
