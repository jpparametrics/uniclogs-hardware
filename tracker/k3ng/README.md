# K3NG Rotator Controller used with UniClOGS

The ground station uses an Arduino and simple interface shield to convert the serial
"Easycom protocol" that _rotctld_ speaks, into the relay output and potentiometer
input expected by the Yaesu G5500 rotator control box.

K3NG has provided an open source solution implementing this Arduino code.

This repo contains some simple instructions on how to get the code, a description of the shield,
and the settings needed by the UniClOGS hardware.
